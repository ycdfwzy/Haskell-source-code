-- |An almost totally wrong Binomial Heap implementation of priority queue.
--
-- However, the example properties (@prop_1_empty_is_empty, prop_2_findMin_the_only_element, prop_3_tautology@) in @test/Spec.hs@ are too weak to detect bugs from this implementation.
--
-- Write more, critical properties in @test/Spec.hs@ to detect bugs from this implementation AND more subtle bugs in other possible implementations!
